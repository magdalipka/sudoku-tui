# Sudoku TUI

Sudoku TUI is an application for solving sudoku in terminal. I am writing this for two reasons: I need an app that will allow me to mark and color cells however I want to (without the need to use MS Paint), and I want to learn Rust. This code might and probably will be awful as I do not know Rust enough, but I intend to make it working somehow.
